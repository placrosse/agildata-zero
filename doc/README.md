# AgilData Zero

## What is AgilData Zero?

**_AgilData Zero_** is a special type of *encrypted database*, called "**Zero Knowledge**".  This means that your data is never, for any reason, available on the actual machine which is used to store the information on disk.  You may confidently deploy to the Cloud, without massive security risks.  If someone does manage to break in and view the information, your encrypted columns will yield nothing.  The keys required for decryption, and unencrypted data, never leave your premises.

Zero is fully compatible with MySQL drivers, wire protocol, and SQL syntax.  This allows you to use all of the tools, applications, and knowledge, you currently have for MySQL.

## Why would I want AgilData Zero.

If you're in the _financial_, _insurance_, _health care_, _online retail_, or any other business with regulatory requirements you definitely will want to see what Zero has to offer.  Even if your use doesn't fall within one of these, you may still find your information in the Cloud worth protecting.
