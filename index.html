<h1>AgilData Zero - Zero-Knowledge Encryption for MySQL</h1>

<p>AgilData Zero is an encryption gateway for MySQL that encrypts sensitive data on the way into the database, and decrypts result sets on the way back out.

<p>Even if the database server is compromised and an unauthorized user is able to login and run SQL queries, no sensitive data is revealed. This contrasts greatly with the traditional approach that databases take, where data is only encrypted in-transit and at-rest, but is available in plain text if someone can login and run queries.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p>This is a work-in-progress and not suitable for production use yet. The main limitations currently are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subset of MySQL syntax supported (just enough to run TPC-C benchmarks)</li>
<li>Depends on rust-crypto which has not been verified as secure yet</li>
<li>Query planner only handles subset of validation required to ensure no unencrypted data can leak to the database server</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security versus Functionality</h2>

<p>One of the challenges with storing encrypted data in a database is that it reduces the databases ability to operate on that data. For example, if data is encrypted with AES-256 then it changes the sort order of that data, so it is no longer possible for the database to perform range queries or sort that data with an `ORDER BY` clause. Weaker forms of encryption exist that can preserve the sort order, but order-preserving encryption is known to leak knowledge about the data, as demonstrated in [cite that paper here]. </p>

<p>AgilData Zero takes a pragmatic approach to the problem by supporting encyrption schemes that allow for some basic operations to be performed by the database. AgilData Zero also validates queries and fails any queries that attempt to perform an operation on encrypted data, rather than just returning the wrong results.</p>
