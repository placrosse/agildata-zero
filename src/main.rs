//! An example [SOCKSv5] proxy server on top of futures
//!
//! [SOCKSv5]: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1928.txt
//!
//! This program is intended to showcase many aspects of the futures crate and
//! I/O integration, explaining how many of the features can interact with one
//! another and also provide a concrete example to see how easily pieces can
//! interoperate with one another.
//!
//! A SOCKS proxy is a relatively easy protocol to work with. Each TCP
//! connection made to a server does a quick handshake to determine where data
//! is going to be proxied to, another TCP socket is opened up to this
//! destination, and then bytes are shuffled back and forth between the two
//! sockets until EOF is reached.
//!
//! This server implementation is relatively straightforward, but
//! architecturally has a few interesting pieces:
//!
//! * The entire server only has one buffer to read/write data from. This global
//!   buffer is shared by all connections and each proxy pair simply reads
//!   through it. This is achieved by waiting for both ends of the proxy to be
//!   ready, and then the transfer is done.
//!
//! * Initiating a SOCKS proxy connection may involve a DNS lookup, and
//!   currently this is done using the standard library, which does blocking
//!   I/O. To prevent the event loop from blocking a worker thread pool is used
//!   to execute DNS lookups and the results are communicated back to the main
//!   event loop thread.
//!
//! * The entire SOCKS handshake is implemented using the various combinators in
//!   the `futures` crate as well as the `futures_io` crate. The actual proxying
//!   of data, however, is implemented through a manual implementation of
//!   `Future`. This shows how it's easy to transition back and forth between
//!   the two, choosing whichever is the most appropriate for the situation at
//!   hand.
//!
//! You can try out this server with `cargo test` or just `cargo run` and
//! throwing connections at it yourself, and there should be plenty of comments
//! below to help walk you through the implementation as well!
